Rep. Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, was an early and ardent supporter of Sanders’ presidential run during the Democratic Primary. As a co-chair of Bernie’s Congressional Progressive Caucus, the two have frequently worked together with other Democrats to introduce progressive legislation such as increasing the minimum wage and banning private prisons.<p>Keith Ellison opposes the TPP and has sponsored legislation that would stop corporations from storing their money in offshore tax havens. He understands that the current concentration of wealth has distorted our democracy and has eroded our country’s social and cultural fabric. He has voted to allow rehabilitated drug convicts to get student loans, to expunge criminal records for first time drug offenders after probation, and has voted NO on more funding for Mexico to fight the failed drug war. Rep. Ellison has also stood in solidarity with the protestors against the North Dakota Access Pipeline when others have remained silent. Keith understood that a populist wave would be sweeping throughout the nation and that a Trump presidency was possible, saying so back in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHkPadFK34o">July 2015</a>.<p>The role of the Democratic National Committee is not a small one. It coordinates and funds candidates throughout the country for local, state, and federal office and is responsible for developing the party platform. In the future, we need progressive Democrats to run in all elections, from school boards in California to Senate races in Wyoming. The American people need to be exposed to a new Democratic Party, a party that has thrown away the shackles of big donors and lobbyists.<p>That is why we must join Bernie Sanders in promoting Representative Keith Ellison. The current leadership of the Democratic Party can no longer afford to ignore our progressive agenda. Ellison understands that Trump tapped into the insecurity and unfairness that many Americans are feeling today. He knows that if Democrats wish to win back seats from Republicans, they need to return to defending trade unions, reverse the decline in working-class wages, and take care of the American people whose livelihoods have been lost to free trade deals. We have already demonstrated that a grassroots movement, Bernie Sander’s Political Revolution, can go toe to toe against even the most well-oiled political machine. Rep. Ellison can help guide this Revolution, pave a path forward for the Democratic Party and restore control of our democracy to the American people.<p>However, if we wish to exert our influence, we must do so quickly. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority leader who advocated giving corporations a giant tax holiday, will be trying to get his choice picked as the new chair. Nancy Pelosi, the incoming House Minority Leader, will be doing the same. We must not let them pick another corporatist Democrat. We can do our part by <a href="http://my.democrats.org/page/s/contact-the-democrats">sending a message directly to the DNC</a> and letting them know that we support Rep. Ellison. We can also contact Schumer (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/senschumer">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/senschumer">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chuckschumer/">Instagram</a> / <a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/email-chuck">Email</a>) and Pelosi (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/nancypelosi">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nancypelosi/">Instagram</a> / <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/contact-me/email-me">Email</a>) and ensure them that we will not blindly follow their leadership choice out of party loyalty.<hr><p> You can comment, follow, and read more from the Political Revolution on <a href="https://medium.com/@OurPoliticalRev">Medium</a>. <br> <script> window.fbAsyncInit = function() { FB.init({ appId : '206987373045662', xfbml : true, version : 'v2.8' }); FB.AppEvents.logPageView(); }; (function(d, s, id){ var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;} js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); </script> <a class="btn-tweet" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bernie%20Sanders%20Endorses%20Keith%20Ellison%20for%20DNC%20Chair&url=https://politicalrev.github.io/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/11/bernie-sanders-endorses-keith-ellison.html&via=OurPoliticalRev">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-share="true" data-width="450" data-show-faces="true"></div></article></main><section id="contact"><footer id="footer"><ul class="icons"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/OurPoliticalRev" class="icon alt fa-twitter" target="_blank"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePoliticalRev/" class="icon alt fa-facebook" target="_blank"><span class="label">Facebook</span></a><li><a href="https://medium.com/@OurPoliticalRev" class="icon alt fa-medium" target="_blank"><span class="label">Medium</span></a><li><a href="https://polrevvols.herokuapp.com/" class="icon alt fa-slack" target="_blank"><span class="label">Slack</span></a><li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution" class="icon alt fa-reddit-alien" target="_blank"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></ul><ul class="copyright"><li>&copy; The Political Revolution</ul></footer><script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/skel.min.js"></script> <!--[if lte IE 8]><script src="https://politicalrev.github.io/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/ie/respond.min.js"></script><![endif]--> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-87007671-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script>
