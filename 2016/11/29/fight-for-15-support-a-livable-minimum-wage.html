This national movement has seen multiple <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/why-new-york-citys-fast-food-workers-are-right-to-strike-for-higher-wages-da410405c39b#.qwcft4vbc">high-profile strikes</a> before, but this may prove to be the most widespread disruption yet, with rallies being planned in hundreds of American cities and 20 major American airports. Additionally, protesters are targeting McDonald’s locations across the country. McDonald’s has been one of the most egregious examples of corporate greed. Their profits rose by 130% between 2009 and 2012 but they still refuse to pay their employees a livable wage.<p>In addition to a higher minimum wage, the <a href="http://fightfor15.org/?r=n">FightFor15</a> movement is also demanding the <strong>right to unionize.</strong> This is a difficult goal, as unions have been oft-maligned in numerous states and have been painted as the root cause behind budgetary problems. However, as union membership has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/24/the-incredible-decline-of-american-unions-in-one-animated-map/">dropped over the decades</a>, the amount of money even non-union workers have missed out on is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/08/30/decline-unions-has-hurt-all-workers-study/89557266/">more than $2,700 each year</a>. Because high-wage union jobs cause non-union employers to increase their wages in order to prevent non-union employees from joining or forming a union, the presence of unions raises the household income of all workers. Furthermore, it has been shown that a higher minimum wage is strongly correlated with a <a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/news/2013/12/03/80222/raising-the-minimum-wage-would-help-not-hurt-our-economy/">decrease in unemployment</a> - the opposite of what living wage opponents claim.<p><img src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/posts/15.jpg" alt="Fight for 15 on Tuesday, November 29" /><p>The FightFor15 movement seeks to rectify this trend of wage loss and union dissolvement and keep the issue of a livable wage at the forefront of the public’s attention, but they need your help. Everyone that joins their marches or demonstrations lends strength to their movement.<p>This Tuesday, November 29th is the time to show our solidarity. <a href="http://action.lowpayisnotok.org/page/content/november29">Pledge</a> to join and receive help finding a rally near you.<hr><p> You can comment, follow, and read more from the Political Revolution on <a href="https://medium.com/@OurPoliticalRev">Medium</a>. <br> <script> window.fbAsyncInit = function() { FB.init({ appId : '206987373045662', xfbml : true, version : 'v2.8' }); FB.AppEvents.logPageView(); }; (function(d, s, id){ var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;} js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); </script> <a class="btn-tweet" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Fight%20for%2015!%20Support%20a%20Livable%20Minimum%20Wage&url=https://politicalrev.github.io/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/29/fight-for-15-support-a-livable-minimum-wage.html&via=OurPoliticalRev">Tweet</a><div class="fb-like" data-share="true" data-width="450" data-show-faces="true"></div></article><aside class="post-list"><h2>Latest Posts</h2><section class="tiles"><article><header class="major"> <span class="image"> <img src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/posts/tpr-logo-vertical.png" alt="" /> </span><h3><a href="/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/29/statement-of-organization.html" class="link">Statement of Organization</a></h3><span class="post-info">29 November 2016</span></header></article><article><header class="major"> <span class="image"> <img src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/bernie-rally.png" alt="" /> </span><h3><a href="/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/16/bernie-sanders-to-speak-at-rally-in-washington-dc.html" class="link">Bernie Sanders to Speak at Rally in Washington DC</a></h3><span class="post-info">16 November 2016</span></header></article><article><header class="major"> <span class="image"> <img src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/posts/dapl-protest.jpg" alt="" /> </span><h3><a href="/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/14/dapl-day-of-action.html" class="link">Rise Up in Solidarity for National Day of Action Against The Dakota Access Pipeline</a></h3><span class="post-info">14 November 2016</span></header></article><article><header class="major"> <span class="image"> <img src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/posts/Keith_Ellison_01.jpg" alt="" /> </span><h3><a href="/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/11/bernie-sanders-endorses-keith-ellison.html" class="link">Bernie Sanders Endorses Keith Ellison for DNC Chair</a></h3><span class="post-info">11 November 2016</span></header></article><article><header class="major"> <span class="image"> <img src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/posts/tpr-logo-vertical.png" alt="" /> </span><h3><a href="/thepoliticalrev.org/2016/11/10/election-results-statement.html" class="link">On the Results of the 2016 Election</a></h3><span class="post-info">10 November 2016</span></header></article></aside></main><footer id="footer"><ul class="icons"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/OurPoliticalRev" class="icon alt fa-twitter" target="_blank"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePoliticalRev/" class="icon alt fa-facebook" target="_blank"><span class="label">Facebook</span></a><li><a href="https://medium.com/@OurPoliticalRev" class="icon alt fa-medium" target="_blank"><span class="label">Medium</span></a><li><a href="https://polrevvols.herokuapp.com/" class="icon alt fa-slack" target="_blank"><span class="label">Slack</span></a><li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution" class="icon alt fa-reddit-alien" target="_blank"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></ul><ul class="copyright"><li>&copy; The Political Revolution</ul></footer><script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js"></script> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/skel.min.js"></script> <!--[if lte IE 8]><script src="https://politicalrev.github.io/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/ie/respond.min.js"></script><![endif]--> <script src="/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-87007671-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script>
