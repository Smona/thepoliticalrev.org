The rally is in direct response to the incoming Trump administration, bringing Progressives together to discuss 
concerns including job creation, climate action, the recent escalation of hate-related violence, and the de facto 
defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Participate in this day of action to help forward the progressive initiative. 
Stop Speaker Ryan from privatizing Medicare, and defend the hard earned rights of Labor in the United States. Hear 
those that are fighting for a Political Revolution, and in turn make your voice heard!


Other groups in support of the rally include: National Nurses United, Our Revolution, AFL-CIO, Communications Workers of 
America, Demand Progress, The People For Bernie Sanders, Amalgamated Transit Union, Transport Workers Union, Working 
Families Party, Democratic Socialists of America, Democracy Spring, The American Postal Workers Union, People's Action,
