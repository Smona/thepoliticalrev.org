On May 26th, 2015, Bernie Sanders announced his Presidential campaign. Out of his campaign arose a rebirth of the Civil Rights movement, and a new fire that spread among the youth of America. 

Senator Sanders’ message is one that has been building and intensifying for decades; generations of people have been fighting for a better America, one that unifies people from all walks of life. People have been fighting for an America that strikes down the decades of failed government that has prevented the American people from leading a life free of oppression; A life free of racism, of fear, of wealth inequality and financial oppression, and of marginalization of our minorities. The voices of those who fight for justice must not be silenced.


## We believe that now is the time to take matters into our own hands.

We of The Political Revolution cannot sit idly by while the livelihood, safety, and integrity of our fellow Americans is threatened by regressive ideas about racial equality, wealth equality, social equality, and gender equality. We will not sit idly by while there is an opportunity to band together the people who supported Bernie Sanders’ message, and move forward into the next era of the Civil Rights movement. While there are people who are willing to fight for our democracy and the right of every American for true freedom, we will fight with them. In other words:


## No, we will not be going gently into that good night. 


This is why core members of The Political Revolution have come together to form a non-connected Political Action Committee. We pledge to: 

- Organize, mobilize, and empower volunteers!
- Educate voters on progressive issues and candidates.
- Support progressive candidates on a federal, state, and local level. 


Our plight is not our own; it is the Political Revolution that calls us to fight for a future to believe in. When we stand ‘in solidarity’, we are saying that ‘your pain is my pain’, and ‘your joy is my joy’. We stand together with the people of America for a brighter future.


In Solidarity,

Gloriann Fields, Amanda Robertson, & David Fredrick,<br>
