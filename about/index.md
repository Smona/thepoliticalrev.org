# What is The Political Revolution?

Born from the now famous call to action in 2016, The Political Revolution is an [all-volunteer]({{ site.baseurl }}fight/index.html) progressive group dedicated to the promotion of candidates, issues, and groups that represent the continuation of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign.

## History

The Political Revolution was founded by the core team of Grassroots for Sanders, a similarly all-volunteer group that reached millions of people, spawned dozens of unique tools, and raised over $12 million dollars for the Sanders’ campaign.

## Today

The Political Revolution presently operates as a portal for candidates to introduce themselves to a national community of active grassroots activists. This outreach means that previously only locally known races can have access to the same progressive base that helped Senator Sanders’ gain such online popularity and support.
