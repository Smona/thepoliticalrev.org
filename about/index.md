> "We need a political revolution of millions of people in this country who are prepared to stand up and say, 'enough is enough' ... I want to help lead that effort." - Sen. Bernie Sanders

The Political Revolution is a collective of [volunteers]({{ site.baseurl }}fight/index.html) that grew out of the Bernie Sanders campaign. We're an organization focused on digital campaigning, and connecting progressives across the nation. Our goal is to support progressive candidates and ballot iniatives on a state-by-state message, and to amplify the message of other like-minded organizations and campaigns.

## History

The Political Revolution was founded by the core team of Grassroots for Sanders, a similarly all-volunteer group that reached millions of people, spawned dozens of unique tools, and raised over $12 million dollars for the Sanders’ campaign.

## Today

The Political Revolution presently operates as a portal for candidates to introduce themselves to a national community of active grassroots activists. This outreach means that previously only locally known races can have access to the same progressive base that helped Senator Sanders’ gain such online popularity and support.

* We support local progressive political candidates
* We support state and congressional progressive candidates
* We support [progressive incumbents]({{ site.baseurl }}candidates/)
* We work on local, state, and congressional issues of social, racial, economic, and environmental justice
* We engage the community around those candidates and issues, and raise awareness for voters across the nation with a targeted social media platform and messaging, and by working with other activist groups.
