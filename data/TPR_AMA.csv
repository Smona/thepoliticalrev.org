My chief issues are combating climate destruction, reforming our campaign finance system, expanding Social Security (and re-financing it through a fairer payroll tax system), taking better care of our veterans, and reducing the insane cost of prescription drugs. You can learn more about my bio here: Meet Tom Wakely\n \nAbout My Opponent My staff tells me that reddit is already somewhat familiar with Lamar Smith from the SOPA days. I think the best way to describe him right now is a 30-year incumbent who is Congress' obstructionist-in-chief. He remains woefully incompetent on climate science and steadfastly committed to stripping women of their rights. It shouldn't be any surprise he endorsed Donald Trump in May, and he was the first sitting member of Congress to allocate funds from his leadership PAC to Trump's campaign. Until the October quarterly, he was the only sitting member of Congress to donate to Donald Trump's campaign.\n \nThere is an obvious choice in this election. Lamar Smith is out of touch with the district. I grew up and graduated from high school in TX-21. This is my home. We're running one hell of a campaign and I'm really looking forward to getting to know some of you this afternoon / evening. I think it's fantastic that you're carrying on a true progressive message into the future. We must continue the good fight! Our campaign isn't funded by a single corporate interest, so if you do feel inclined we've set up a special ActBlue page for Reddit right here.\n \nAnd of course, here's our proof!\n \nEdit: We have a way for you to make phone calls from home! Please go to Talk for Tom!\n \nEdit (6:40 Central / 7:40 Eastern): Wow, time flew by on this one. This was a blast and a great exercise on policy. You guys are so bright.

I want to reform our judicial system to eliminate for profit prisons and offer a path for non-violent felons to expunge their record after a reasonable period of time. https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mikemanypennyforcongress2016 http://www.manypennyforcongress.us/donate-volunteer/ http://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/527-manypenny-for-congress https://www.facebook.com/mikemanypenny1/ @manypenny2016","https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mikemanypennyforcongress2016; http://www.manypennyforcongress.us/donate-volunteer/; http://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/527-manypenny-for-congress; https://www.facebook.com/mikemanypenny1/","https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mikemanypennyforcongress2016; http://www.manypennyforcongress.us/donate-volunteer/; http://www2.democracyforamerica.com/endorsement_applicants/527-manypenny-for-congress; https://www.facebook.com/mikemanypenny1/"

I'm Charlie Hardy. Some people call me the Bernie Sanders of Wyoming, but I sometimes like to think of Bernie Sanders of the Charlie Hardy of the United States!\n \nI’m a 77 year old former Catholic priest who, after many years of service to communities in my native state, spent 8 years living in a cardboard shack in a Venezuelan slum. A priest is meant to live among the people that he is called to serve, after all. \n \nIn 2011, I returned to my hometown of Cheyenne and was shocked to see poverty, hunger and homelessness. After being snubbed by my congressional representatives, I decided to run for office myself in 2014 and managed to win the Democratic Party’s nomination for the US Senate. My campaign attracted a wonderful group of young volunteers determined to make waves in Wyoming’s elections, and in doing so set a precedent for the rest of the country. My Republican opponent had a $3 million war chest, and my advisors urged me to focus on fundraising. Instead, I rejected money from special interests and made campaign finance reform a key part of my platform. \n \nWe lost the election in 2014, but that didn’t get me down. In early 2016, I decided to run again, this time for the House of Representatives. Once again, our campaign was powered by people, not money, and our team of volunteers returned to Cheyenne from all corners of the country with the same hopeful determination. Despite their very hard work, we lost the Democratic Party nomination in the primary last week. But, in the capital city of Cheyenne where we canvassed, we won against our opponent who outspent us 10 to 1!\n \nAnd I’m not stopping anytime soon. We’re inspired by Our Revolution, and we’re ready to do our part. We’re here today talking about Charlie vs Goliath, a film that tells my story. But it’s not just my story. It’s the story of a movement that is building, a movement that we’re all a part of. How can this film help that movement? That’s what we’re here to find out.\n \nYou know, I marvel at the journalists who travel to different parts of the world wanting to tell people’s stories, the stories that otherwise might never be told. I’m joining you today with one of those amazing individuals and my very good friend, Reed Lindsay. Ask us anything! \n \nProof: https://imgur.com/a/QXBDm\n \nReed Lindsay \n \nAnd I’m Reed Lindsay, Director of Charlie vs Goliath. I’m a filmmaker and independent journalist with 15 years of experience reporting, investigating, writing, producing, filming and directing around the world. I’ve traveled the globe to bring marginalized voices to the fore, to expose injustices and abuse of power, to create awareness about issues that have been ignored or misunderstood and to challenge the mainstream narratives that are devoid of context or distort local realities. \n \nI met Charlie 13 years ago in Latin America, and we have been close ever since. I also grew up in the Mountain West, in a small town in Idaho, but I had never been to Cheyenne until Charlie convinced me to check out his US Senate campaign in 2014. Honestly, I thought he was crazy! I planned on spending a few weeks in Wyoming, but was so inspired by Charlie and his young volunteers, I've dedicated the last two years to making this film.\n \nI lived in a poor neighborhood in Port-au-Prince, Haiti for more than four years, where I worked as a journalist and supported a group of community volunteers who formed tuition-free schools in the slums of the city. I was one of the first journalists to enter Libya after the uprising, and I co-directed hour-long film entitled Benghazi Rising that was nominated for a Rory Peck Award in 2011. I reported on the Egyptian rebellion from beginning to end and was a co-winner of an Emmy for my contribution to the HBO documentary In Tahrir Square.\n \nMy dream is to take Charlie and the film on a national tour, working in solidarity with The Political Revolution and other grassroots organizers to hold screenings around the country. We'd bring audiences together, inspire them with the film and then hold Q&As, panels, workshops or anything else that could help grow the movement. Documentary film can be a powerful tool for social change, and we hope this film can be a powerful tool for Our Revolution. \n \nBut first, we need to finish the film. Like Charlie’s campaign, this film is powered by people, not money, and over the last three weeks, four of us have been slaving away at our Kickstarter campaign. We have other jobs (I’m in Cuba right now covering another story!), and we’re working day and night. We have a long way to go to reach our Kickstarter goal, and we only have a week left.

Challenging the belief that our political process is fair and democratic, Charlie vs Goliath explores the question of how an honest and sincere person without money can make a difference running for higher office, and more broadly, whether, in the spirit of Don Quixote, it is worth fighting an unbeatable foe and dreaming an impossible dream. \n \nAnd check out our teaser trailer here: https://vimeo.com/145341296\n \ntl;dr We’re here in solidarity.

I’m Keri Thompson. I'm a college professor and longtime progressive activist who's been a member of both major political parties. I'm running for State Representative in Massachusetts’ 3rd Plymouth District on the south shore (the towns of Cohasset, Hingham, Hull, and North Scituate) as a member of the United Independent Party (UIP). I’m running because it's time to challenge a broken system and provide real choice for voters in a state where most elections go unopposed.\n \nThe primary is on September 8th, and in my district this year the State Representative race is shaping up to be a logistical fiasco that is guaranteed to confuse and discourage voters and keep those in power in place. Here’s the situation: The incumbent (a Democrat who held the seat for 16 years and almost always ran unopposed) resigned unexpectedly, and too late for anyone else to get on the ballot. There are five of us running in the primary for an open seat, and we all need at least 150 write-in votes in the September 8 primary to make it onto the November ballot. We are doing our best to get the word out, but we need as many people as possible to help mobilize the vote in my district! \n \nI joined the United Independent Party and started my campaign because I believe the moment is now to challenge entrenched, corrupted power - starting with our fundamentally flawed two-party system. 53% of Massachusetts voters are registered as unenrolled (Independent), and yet one party (the Democrats) controls about 90% of the seats. UIP is uniting these Independents: providing the structure and resources candidates need to effectively run for office, acting as a platform for progressive candidates, while also allowing us to be ourselves. UIP candidates are never asked to conform to a party platform, make shady deals, or compromise our values. And they’re working from the bottom-up: running candidates at state and local levels first, building a power base, and creating change that truly starts with the grassroots.\n \nPartisan fighting only blocks good policy and effective change. Major endorsements I’ve received from members of both major political parties - Scott Harshbarger (D) (former Attorney General in MA) and Gabriel Gomez (R) (former MA nominee for US Senate) - are proving that we’re transcending party lines as we unite to fight for voters’ priorities. I am prepared to fight to help Massachusetts lead on important policy, including:\n \nA $15 minimum wage Addressing climate change - starting with a transition to a green infrastructure and economy that creates jobs and protects our environment Advocating on behalf of the food justice movement to stop corporate interests from jeopardizing our food safety, environment, and agriculture system Repairing our crumbling infrastructure and public transportation systems - which would provide thousands of jobs as well as new opportunities for the poorest in our state Ending discriminatory “tough on crime” criminal justice practices Legalizing marijuana on the Massachusetts ballot in November Opposing common core testing standards Gender equality that is truly inclusive and intersectional Making higher education a reality and affordable for all Better transparency, accountability, and accessibility of elected officials, as well as term limits\n \nThere is a system to keep those in power in place, and I am actively going up against it. It’s tough being pioneers in a political revolution, but we can win this together! I hope I can count your support:\n \nDonate - joinkeri.org/donate Website - joinkeri.org Twitter - @kerithompson Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat - @joinkeri United Independent Party: unitedindependent.org\n \nASK ME ANYTHING! \n \nIn solidarity, Keri\n \nRockTheBoat!\n \nPS: a story. I gave up my standing as a delegate for Bernie at the DNC in order to run. It was a tough decision - to stay a member of the Democratic Party (a party I devoted years of my life to, but now see as fundamentally broken) in order to cast my vote for Bernie, or give that up so I could answer Bernie's call to action to run for office. Ultimately, I decided the best way to do my part in continuing the revolution would be to run. I think it's what Bernie would want, and I hope you agree. <3; Hi everyone! I’m Keri Thompson.

UIP is uniting these Independents: providing the structure and resources candidates need to effectively run for office, acting as a platform for progressive candidates, while also allowing us to be ourselves. UIP candidates are never asked to conform to a party platform, make shady deals, or compromise our values. And they’re working from the bottom-up: running candidates at state and local levels first, building a power base, and creating change that truly starts with the grassroots.\n \nPartisan fighting only blocks good policy and effective change. Major endorsements I’ve received from members of both major political parties - Scott Harshbarger (D) (former Attorney General in MA) and Gabriel Gomez (R) (former MA nominee for US Senate) - are proving that we’re transcending party lines as we unite to fight for voters’ priorities. I am prepared to fight to help Massachusetts lead on important policy, including:\n \nA $15 minimum wage Addressing climate change - starting with a transition to a green infrastructure and economy that creates jobs and protects our environment Advocating on behalf of the food justice movement to stop corporate interests from jeopardizing our food safety, environment, and agriculture system Repairing our crumbling infrastructure and public transportation systems - which would provide thousands of jobs as well as new opportunities for the poorest in our state Ending discriminatory “tough on crime” criminal justice practices Legalizing marijuana on the Massachusetts ballot in November Opposing common core testing standards Gender equality that is truly inclusive and intersectional Making higher education a reality and affordable for all Better transparency, accountability, and accessibility of elected officials, as well as term limits\n \nThere is a system to keep those in power in place, and I am actively going up against it. It’s tough being pioneers in a political revolution, but we can win this together! I hope I can count your support:\n \nDonate - joinkeri.org/donate Website - joinkeri.org Twitter - @kerithompson Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat - @joinkeri United Independent Party: unitedindependent.org\n \nASK ME ANYTHING! \n \nIn solidarity, Keri\n \nRockTheBoat!\n \nPS: a story. I gave up my standing as a delegate for Bernie at the DNC in order to run. It was a tough decision - to stay a member of the Democratic Party (a party I devoted years of my life to, but now see as fundamentally broken) in order to cast my vote for Bernie, or give that up so I could answer Bernie's call to action to run for office. Ultimately, I decided the best way to do my part in continuing the revolution would be to run. I think it's what Bernie would want, and I hope you agree. <3","",""
