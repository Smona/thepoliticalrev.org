Rep. Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, was an early and ardent supporter of Sanders’ presidential run during the Democratic Primary. As a co-chair of Bernie’s Congressional Progressive Caucus, the two have frequently worked together with other Democrats to introduce progressive legislation such as increasing the minimum wage and banning private prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith Ellison opposes the TPP and has sponsored legislation that would stop corporations from storing their money in offshore tax havens. He understands that the current concentration of wealth has distorted our democracy and has eroded our country’s social and cultural fabric. He has voted to allow rehabilitated drug convicts to get student loans, to expunge criminal records for first time drug offenders after probation, and has voted NO on more funding for Mexico to fight the failed drug war. Rep. Ellison has also stood in solidarity with the protestors against the North Dakota Access Pipeline when others have remained silent. Keith understood that a populist wave would be sweeping throughout the nation and that a Trump presidency was possible, saying so back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHkPadFK34o&quot;&gt;July 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the Democratic National Committee is not a small one. It coordinates and funds candidates throughout the country for local, state, and federal office and is responsible for developing the party platform. In the future, we need progressive Democrats to run in all elections, from school boards in California to Senate races in Wyoming. The American people need to be exposed to a new Democratic Party, a party that has thrown away the shackles of big donors and lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we must join Bernie Sanders in promoting Representative Keith Ellison. The current leadership of the Democratic Party can no longer afford to ignore our progressive agenda. Ellison understands that Trump tapped into the insecurity and unfairness that many Americans are feeling today. He knows that if Democrats wish to win back seats from Republicans, they need to return to defending trade unions, reverse the decline in working-class wages, and take care of the American people whose livelihoods have been lost to free trade deals. We have already demonstrated that a grassroots movement, Bernie Sander’s Political Revolution, can go toe to toe against even the most well-oiled political machine. Rep. Ellison can help guide this Revolution, pave a path forward for the Democratic Party and restore control of our democracy to the American people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we wish to exert our influence, we must do so quickly. Nancy Pelosi, the incoming House Minority Leader, is one of many who will be trying to get her choice picked as the new chair. We must not let the DNC pick another corporatist Democrat. We can do our part by &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.democrats.org/page/s/contact-the-democrats&quot;&gt;sending a message directly to the DNC&lt;/a&gt; and letting them know that we support Rep. Ellison. We can also contact Pelosi (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nancypelosi&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/nancypelosi/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://pelosi.house.gov/contact-me/email-me&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;) and assure her that we will not blindly follow her leadership choice out of party loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lend your support by joining the Facebook Page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KeithForDNC/&quot;&gt;Keith For DNC&lt;/a&gt; and make your voice heard by signing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pac.petitions.moveon.org/sign/appoint-keith-ellison?source=keithfordnc&amp;amp;fb_test=0&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; to Appoint Keith Ellison as DNC Chair!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harpreet Chima</name></author><summary type="html">Today, Bernie Sanders has thrown his support behind Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison for Chairman of the Democratic National Convention.

&lt;p&gt;Last night’s election is a somber reminder for the progressive movement in the United States: progress is not a guarantee.  The executive branch is now completely under Republican control and many of our down-ballot hopefuls were unsuccessful. Despite these setbacks, we must continue fighting for a brighter future for all Americans, no matter how long it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the time to lose hope. Now is not the time to give up on the American Dream, nor to resign ourselves to four years of stagnation and regression. We must recognize the power that comes from our collective outrage. We must continue to use our power to energize, protest, and act with vigor towards progressive change. Now is the time to stand together boldly and say &lt;strong&gt;“Enough is Enough!”&lt;/strong&gt; We must stand together with our allies in the face of this new adversity and proclaim that we will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be silenced. We will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; allow all the progress we have made so far to be undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fight for change in the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential elections begins today. We will influence our representatives through petitions and by phone and letter writing campaigns. We will get involved in local politics to find candidates who represent our message. We will take advantage of the next two years and be ready for the next election. Most importantly, we will never lose faith in the movement that Bernie Sanders started and we will continue to forge a path forward for The Political Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, we can look at November 8th and chalk up &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourrevolution.com/election-2016/&quot;&gt;dozens of wins&lt;/a&gt; for Bernie-endorsed candidates!  It is now up to us to move past the disappointment of the election results and begin our fight a new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, it is crucial that we do not let our anger and spite stand in the way of our ultimate goals. We must trust those who stand with us, and we must work to make allies of our enemies. This election has shown just how divided Americans are, but no matter our personal grievances, no one is a lost cause. We will find common ground, and from that ground we will build a new era of American politics.
	Please help us by &lt;a href=&quot;http://polrevvols.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;joining our volunteer troops&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Solidarity,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Political Revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>The Political Revolution</name></author><summary type="html">Dear Fellow Americans,</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://politicalrev.github.io/thepoliticalrev.org/assets/images/posts/tpr-logo-vertical.png" /></entry></feed>
